# SailsJS API application

[Sails](https://sailsjs.com/) is the most popular MVC framework for Node.js,

designed to emulate the familiar MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails,

but with support for the requirements of modern apps: data-driven APIs with a scalable, service-oriented architecture.

this project aims to explain concepts of the sailsjs app,

from actions and controllers to models and orm.
